# Azure Hybrid Identity with Password Hash Synchronisation

## Project Abstract

Modern organisations commonly maintain on-premises Active Directory environments while also using cloud-based applications and services. Managing separate identities and passwords in these environments can increase administrative effort and create an inconsistent user experience. This project, **Azure Hybrid Identity with Password Hash Synchronisation**, proposes and demonstrates a hybrid identity architecture that connects an on-premises Active Directory environment with Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Connect and Password Hash Synchronisation (PHS).

The project begins by establishing an Active Directory environment with test users and configuring the required Microsoft Azure resources. Microsoft Entra ID is then prepared as the cloud identity platform, and Microsoft Entra Connect is configured to synchronize selected on-premises identities to the cloud. Password Hash Synchronisation enables users to use their existing organisational credentials when accessing supported cloud resources, without requiring the original on-premises password to be transferred to Microsoft Entra ID.

The implementation also focuses on practical identity-management issues such as synchronization errors, duplicate user attributes, and incorrect filtering configurations. Appropriate filtering is used to control which accounts are synchronized, while synchronization and sign-in tests are performed to verify the expected behaviour. The project therefore provides a practical view of how hybrid identity can reduce the need for separate cloud credentials while maintaining controlled identity synchronization between on-premises and cloud environments.

## Objectives

- Set up an on-premises Active Directory environment for testing.
- Connect on-premises identities with Microsoft Entra ID using Microsoft Entra Connect.
- Configure Password Hash Synchronisation for hybrid authentication.
- Verify user synchronization and cloud sign-in using synchronized identities.
- Identify and address common synchronization and filtering problems.
